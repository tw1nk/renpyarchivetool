# renpyarchivetool
Extract files from ren'py archives

I'm refuse to run python which is why I ported the functionality I needed from [github.com/Shizmob/rpatool](https://github.com/Shizmob/rpatool) to Go.

I added filetype detection to set correct filetype extensions of files which for one reason or another implies they are a different file type then they really are.
